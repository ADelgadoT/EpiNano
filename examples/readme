Example files include:

  Fastq Files and fast5 files basecalled by albacore v2.1.7
  Reference sequences file, with correspondent dictionary file created using Picard's CreateSequenceDictionary functionality.
  
  *** since there are limits to both the size and number of files by github, we put fast5 files in multiple subfolders, which were then tared and copressed.
